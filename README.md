# CIFAR-10 CNN Training and Deployment on AWS SageMaker

## Introduction
In this project, we will explore how to train, save, load, deploy, and run a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on five batches of CIFAR-10 images. While we have previously experimented with deploying models using cloud services like virtual machines and containers, this assignment focuses on deploying the model on a distributed system using AWS SageMaker. To provide a meaningful comparison, we also ran the same script on a local machine and compared the results.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
### Definition
CNNs are a class of deep neural networks, primarily applied to analyzing visual imagery.

### Components
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from input images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Downsample the feature maps to reduce dimensionality.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform high-level reasoning based on extracted features.

### Uses
- Image and video recognition
- Image classification
- Medical image analysis
- And more

## Training CNN on CIFAR-10
### Preprocessing
- Normalize images to standardize pixel values.
- Apply augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and improve model accuracy.

### Model Architecture
Example: A simple CNN architecture with a combination of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

### Training
- Divide the dataset into five batches.
- Train the CNN iteratively using the batches.

### Evaluation
Validate the model using a separate test set to assess its performance.

## Introduction to Amazon SageMaker
### Overview
AWS SageMaker is a fully managed service that enables developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models efficiently.

### Features
- Scalable training jobs
- One-click deployment
- Built-in Jupyter notebooks
- Support for multiple ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)

## Roadmap in a Nutshell

### 1. Preparing Data in SageMaker
- **Data Storage**: Upload CIFAR-10 data to Amazon S3 for secure, scalable storage.
- **Access Data**: Use SageMaker's API to fetch data from S3 during training.

### 2. Configuring the CNN Model
- **Model Setup**: Define the CNN architecture using SageMaker's deep learning framework support (e.g., TensorFlow).
- **Environment**: Configure the computing environment with the appropriate instance types and quantities (e.g., GPU instances).

### 3. Training the Model
- **Distributed Training**: Use SageMaker's distributed training features to accelerate training across multiple instances.
- **Monitoring**: Track training progress and metrics using SageMaker's built-in experiment tracking tools.

### 4. Deploying the Model
- **Deployment**: Deploy the trained CNN model as a SageMaker endpoint for real-time or batch predictions.

By comparing the performance of SageMaker's distributed training capabilities with that of a local machine, we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of deploying machine learning models on AWS. This project serves as a comprehensive example of leveraging cloud-based tools for advanced deep learning workflows.
