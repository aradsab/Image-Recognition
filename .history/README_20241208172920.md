Introduction
In this presentation we will focus on how to train, save, load, deploy and run a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on 5 batches of CIFAR images. As we have done this before with different cloud services such as virtual machines and containers, in this assignment we will deploy the model on a distributed system (Sagemaker by AWS) which will demonstrate fascinating results. For the sake of comparison, we have also ran the same script on local machine which will be compared to sagemaker.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Definition: A class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
Components: Consists of layers like convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Uses: Image and video recognition, image classification, medical image analysis, and more.
Training CNN on CIFAR-10
Preprocessing: Normalization and augmentation of images to prevent overfitting and improve model accuracy.
Model Architecture: Example - using a simple CNN with layers.
Training: Divide the dataset into 5 batches and iteratively train the CNN.
Evaluation: Validate the model using a separate set of images to assess performance.
Introduction to Amazon SageMaker
Overview: A fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly.
Features: Scalable training jobs, one-click deployment, built-in Jupyter notebooks, and broad framework support.
Roadmap in a nutshell
Preparing Data in SageMaker
Data Storage: Upload CIFAR-10 data to Amazon S3 for secure, scalable, and durable storage.
Access Data: Utilize SageMaker's API to access data from S3 during training.
Configuring the CNN Model
Model Setup: Define a CNN model architecture using SageMaker's pre-built deep learning frameworks support (TensorFlow).
Environment: Set up the computing environment with the necessary instance types and quantities (e.g., GPU instances).
Training the Model
Distributed Training: Leverage SageMaker's distributed training features to speed up training on multiple instances.
Monitoring: Use SageMaker's experiment tracking to monitor training progress and metrics.
Deploying the Model
Deployment: Deploy the trained CNN model as a SageMaker endpoint for real-time or batch predictions.
